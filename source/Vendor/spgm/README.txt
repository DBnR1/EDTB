 SPGM - Simple Picture Gallery Manager
======================================
README.txt                      v1.4.7


  SPGM is a PHP script that displays picture galleries on the web. It is 
intended to provide a very simple way to set up online photo albums: creating 
directories, filling them with pictures and uploading... That is what it's 
all about ! 

It is massively configurable though, and you can tune the layout just as much
as you want to match your exact website's design. Several cool features are 
also included, while keeping in mind that it aims to be as lightweight and 
simple as possible. Don't expect automatic thumbnail generation, advanced 
search functions, nor per-gallery full statistics then. 

SPGM generates XHTML 1.0 Strict compliant code and makes extensive use of CSS 
stylesheets to render galleries. It only requires PHP version 3 or higher 
and does not rely on image manipulation libraries (like GD), or any database
system whatsoever. 

A few features: 

* gallery/picture captioning
* infinite sub-galleries hierarchies 
* per gallery complete configuration (inheritance supported)
* several sort options for both pictures and galleries
* random/fixed thumbnails used for gallery previews 
* new pictures highlighting
* hidden galleries
* EXIF data
* slideshow
* runs as a standalone application or as part of a template
* multi-language support (34 languages are currently provided)
* themes available for use

SPGM is free for use (distributed under the GPL license), very easy to set up
and manage... It makes you just a few clicks away from getting your photo 
albums on the web. 



Feel free to email me at <spajot(at)users.sourceforge.net> for any help, 
suggestion, bug report... And don't forget to rate SPGM from the website ;)
Enjoy !
